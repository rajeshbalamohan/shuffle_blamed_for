Objective:
- Sometimes due to bad machines shuffle tries to blame the source nodes for bad data. If there are 100s of machine involved, it could take a little
bit of time to figure out which machine to look out for. This simple (too basic) tool helps in nailing down which machines to look out for.

1. mvn clean package.

2. java -cp ./target/*:./target/lib/*: ShuffleBlamedForParser yarn-app.log
This should genrate the output.txt in local folder, which should contain the details of task, source (which holds the data), fetcher machine (which is trying to pull data),
failure count etc. In console, the source and fetcher machine details are printed

3. E.g output in console. From this, it is easy to figure out that machine1088 needs to be concentrated on  (as all other nodes are pointing to this machine as the source)

4. In case if you are using "HDP 2.3.4", which has different tez where the log file format changed, you need to uncomment a line in the source code and run "mvn clean package". This is mentioned in the source code.
